### Brief Description

I built the [Unscented Kalman Filter](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/media/pdf/Julier1997_SPIE_KF.pdf) which takes inputs from sensor fusion - LiDAR and RADAR). The following figure is the processign flow the filter.

All of the process are implemented in `ukf.cpp`

### Simulation

The compiled program can communicate with the simulator by [uWebSocket](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets). Here is the captured image after the simulation is done for `Dataset 1`.

### Parameter Tunning : Process Noise

In this project, two process noises - standard deviations of `longitudinal acceleration` and `yaw acceleration` experimentally. To check the consistency of the parameters, I calculated the NIS(Noirmalized Innovation Squared) between the predicted state and the ground truth. The following is the plot of the NIS values earned from final parameters.
